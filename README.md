# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using Machine Learning.
K-Means clustering is applied to group customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score.
The aim is to understand customer behavior and divide them into meaningful groups.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer information with the following columns:
- CustomerID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1–100)

In this project, Annual Income and Spending Score are mainly used for customer segmentation.


## Methodology
The following steps were performed in this project:
- Data loading and basic exploration
- Selecting relevant features (Income and Spending Score)
- Using the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters
- Applying K-Means clustering
- Visualizing customer clusters

## Results
The K-Means algorithm successfully divided customers into different groups.
Each cluster represents customers with similar income and spending behavior.

## Conclusion
Customer segmentation helps businesses understand different types of customers.
This analysis can be used to create better marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
